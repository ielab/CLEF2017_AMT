I immediately felt like I was drowning and coughed up a handful of bright red blood. I went to the ER, where they took blood samples and did a chest x-ray. They said everything looked great and that I was healthy and discharged me with \"Idiopathic Hemoptysis\". \nThe next day, I was fine, and went about my life as usual. Then, the next time I had my period, I had the sudden urge to cough and there was the blood again. Thinking they might be related, I scheduled an appointment with the \"best gyno in town\" according to his reviews online. I told him of my issues and he said he had never heard of hemoptysis being related to menstruation. He performed a pap smear/etc and sent me on my way. I received a post card thing in the mail saying everything was normal. \nA few months later, not only was I coughing up blood, but I was also having difficulty breathing, chest pain, a strange sensation like popcorn was popping in my chest (that's the only way I can think to describe it), and a severe lack of energy to the point where I felt like I could pass out at any moment. I went to the ER yet again and they did a chest x-ray, ekg, and took blood. My ekg and chest x-ray were \"textbook\" they said, and my bloodwork showed I was in great health.\nEvery single month since April of 2013, I cough up blood during my period and only during that time. I have never coughed up blood at any other time. Sometimes it is just a little bit or a few streaks of bright red blood, other times it is darker and clotted and looks exactly like my period. My periods have gone from my typical 3-5 days of heavy bleeding to 1 day of extremely heavy bleeding and 1-2 days of light/almost non existent bleeding. \nI have not had any children. I have been pregnant once and had an abortion in July of 2012. Other than that, I have only had one other surgery and that was a tonsillectomy when I was 15. \nToday marks the first time that I have ever experienced this two days in a row. Usually it is just one day of my period, and it has always been on my worst/heaviest day. This time, I coughed up a tiny amount of blood last night during my extremely heavy day. And today, I am barely menstruating at all, but I am coughing up more blood. It is very dark, almost black in color, and clotted. I called to try to get seen today, but have an appointment scheduled for the 18th. I won't be experiencing any symptoms then, but I'm hoping someone will take an interest in my case instead of just writing me off as healthy and normal. Because coughing up blood 25 months in a row is not healthy or normal.  \nCan anyone offer any insight into my situation? I am concerned that my condition may be life-threatening, and coughing up blood is a very alarming symptom to experience. I had a chest x-ray just last month due to extreme heartburn and acid reflux which has developed in the past couple of months. Once again, the chest x-ray looked fine. I am at my wits end with this. Thanks for your time.\n",

Some passersby brought me some ice and called an ambulance which took me to the ER, and at the ER they took x-rays and told me that it wasn't broken. By that point the pain had nearly totally disappeared without me having taken any painkillers (even OTC). The ER put me in a knee-high stiff walking boot and crutches and I was able to hobble out of there.\nI've been wearing the boot since I left the hospital and have been surprised at the lack of pain I'm experiencing. My ankle is swollen and has just begun to show signs of bruising.\nPossibly relevant side note: About 10 years ago I had a lapidus bunionectomy on my right foot (the same side as my injured ankle) and three screws were placed in the center of my foot to stabilize the bones. My doctor tells me I have unusually flexible ligaments, which caused the bunion and foot pain. \nI've spoken to the orthopedic surgeon's office (the same one who did my bunionectomy) about my ankle and they directed me to continue wearing the boot for two weeks until I see them for a follow-up appointment.\nMy question is about recovery time for this kind of injury.

My girlfriend said it's probably an allergy because my room hasn't been cleaned in the longest time and it's really dirty and dusty, so I could believe that.

Now I haven't been doing this for longer than 2 days straight at best in a row because it's just disgusting but he told me to do it for about a week, and also drink honey and thee and stuff.\nAnyway this is all I can think of, if there's anything else I can specify let me now.

We have seen several doctors but they all are at a loss and seem very unconcerned since none of her symptoms are particularly terrible - however, they are pretty drastically affecting her daily life.  If anyone has any idea about things to look into and ask her doctor about, we would be forever grateful.\nShe's 27, 5'3\", 120 lbs.  White, southern california, no current diagnosed issues and no medication.  Up until this last year, when she hasn't been able to because of symptoms, she was very active.  Gym 2x/week, and she dances and choreographs for a living.  She still choreographs and is fairly active despite her difficulties, but less so than before.\nSymptoms:\n\nNumbness in fingers, nose, and lips when active or resting (comes and goes, but happens a few times a week and can last all day)\nFeeling faint and dizzy (but has not actually fainted) when active or resting\nShortness of breath\nIrregular heartbeats (she says it feels like it pauses, and then \"ker-thumps\")\nExtremely tired and fatigued (about 80% of the time)\nFrequently losing her balance when active or resting (she says she feels like she loses her balance sometimes when she's sitting or laying down, which is odd)\nFeeling \"hazy\" in her body\nHeartbeat often slow when she's physically active or very fast when she's resting\nThough she is often sleepy, she sometimes has trouble sleeping through the night or falling asleep - takes melatonin or Zzzquil on occasion, which helps.  Maybe 2x a week for the past 2 months. Not sure if relevant.\nVery frequent muscle twitches - especially in left eye and in fingers\n\nThings the doctors have checked:\n\nBasic blood work - she's not anemic, her electrolytes are normal, not diabetic, and anything else that would come up in that test was normal.  Vitamins B and D were good.\nThey gave her an event heart monitor for a month - the doctor thought there may be a structural issue with her heart.  She recorded several episodes but they all were deemed normal and not a heart problem.\nHeart echo (ultrasound) - normal \nEKG and stress test - monitored her heart at rest and on the treadmill, normal\nblood pressure, heart rate and breath rate are all within normal range - we have a blood pressure doodad at home and tracked it throughout the day for a couple months, as well as checking at every doctor visit - all normal\nMRI to check for seizures or unusual brain stuff, normal\ngiven anxiety medication by the neurologist that did not help, went to see a psychologist who did not think she was anxious or had any other mental issue\ntried cutting caffeine from her diet, eating very healthy, doctor had suggested more salt in her diet (?) so we tried that for a while, she drinks plenty of water every day, and keeps her sleep schedule regular (though often so tired/fatigued that she naps during the day as well)\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions about things to look into at this point?  We don't know what else to ask the doctors about, and none of our friends and acquaintances have any ideas.\nThank you so much.\n\nNot sure if relevant - she and her twin were born very early, given steroids before even born to fully develop their lungs.  Both her brother and her sister have asthma, though she was never diagnosed with it.\n\n",

        "description": "Hey Reddit,\nI don\u2019t necessarily have a problem or a condition; I just want some insight from people more educated than I. \nA few years ago (freshman year of college) I got mono and was subsequently hospitalized. I had a high fever, incredibly swollen tonsils, lymph node swelling, etc. They put me on a course of steroids and pain medication and kept me in the hospital for about two weeks. I didn\u2019t eat much at all during those two weeks because I couldn\u2019t stand the pain of swallowing. I would have some ice cream and some yoghurt occasionally but not much else. I was also basically bed-ridden and only got up to stumble to the bathroom.  When they discharged me I could barely walk because I\u2019m assuming the muscles started atrophying in my legs due to lack of use and lack of nutritional protein. I also had lost almost 20 lbs. \nAfter I was discharged, I recovered in my dorm room for the next week or so but still didn\u2019t go to class. So in all I missed about 3.5 weeks of classes and midterms were approaching. It was my first semester of school and I didn\u2019t want to get behind academically so I thought I would do my best to make up the work and take the midterms with everybody else. Well surprisingly I studied and almost aced the midterms. And for the next two weeks everything academically seemed a lot easier. My ability to concentrate, absorb material, and understand new concepts was vastly improved. Eventually these abilities went away and I was back to my normal self. \nWell I\u2019ve always wanted to feel that way again. Here are my thoughts on what could have caused the change:\n1)  The diet of strictly yoghurt (and a little ice cream) drastically and positively altered my microbiome.\n2)  3 weeks of caloric restriction caused many changes in my body including reducing inflammation and body fat percentage and altering hormones and probably many other things.\n3)  3 weeks without anxiety and worries unrelated to my illness. While I was in the hospital I was pretty relaxed and really didn\u2019t have to worry about much. I was pretty confident that I was going to recover. \n4)   The heavy course of steroids that they gave me reduced bodily inflammation and did tons of other things.\n5)  Some combination of the above\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\nTldr: Mono made me smarter\n",

This afternoon he vomited from pain, said that wearing a lumbar support belt did alleviate the pain somewhat, and that wearing tighter boxer briefs made it feel better. He masturbated this afternoon, and the semen was bloody, but he said it made the pain much better. He does not have a fever, but was sweating a lot yesterday.

During that time they took out my catheter, but I was unable to urinate because the epidural I had blocked my ability to pee. To my horror, they had to reinsert it, but this time I was awake.\nAfter getting out of hospital, I had pain during my erections when my penis laid flat on my stomach. The pain was inside and at the base of the penis. I did not have any pain when urinating or when my penis was flaccid.

I went to my doctor and he said it was just bruising from the catheter and that it would go away. \nIt's been about 2 weeks since I saw my doctor and recently the pain has gotten worse. I first noticed the progression when I tried to masterbate. My erection was slightly painful and attempting to masterbate hurt so I stopped. Since then I haven't had an erection but I'm pretty sure that my pain is not from bruising since it has gotten worse.

        "description": "Hi there. The patient (daughter of my best friend), has been sick in various ways since the beginning of the year. At first it seemed like an extended cold or flu, which included an ear infection, for which she took antibiotics. There was also a household dosing of Combantrin, because of worms in another family member. There is a slight possibility of swallowing river water. Patient is female, five years old, average height and weight, Caucasian, no medications, no history of medical complaints prior to this year, very healthy diet, usually very active (other than for the past few weeks, due to fatigue). \nCurrent symptoms as follows:\n\nPersistent lethargy. Much reduced energy levels.\nSlightly swollen lymph glands. They were very swollen when she had the cold or flu.\nBloating after eating, especially when food has higher sugar content (porridge with added honey, yogurt).\nPain in stomach area, especially after eating. \nReduced appetite. Not greatly reduced, but definitely some reduction. \nIntermittent appearance of hives, about once per month. Sometimes they have covered her entire body. Local doctor said likely food reaction, but was not sure. \n\nBlood tests were done on the basics. Most things came up normal, but several were abnormal, without a clearly related pattern (for us). Abnormal blood results as follows:\n\nGlucose - Low - 3.1 \nIron - Low - 4.0\nC-reactive protein - High - 9.5\nTSH - High - 7.3\nMonocytes - High - 1.0\n\nIf anything occurs to you I'd appreciate hearing it. Thank you for your time. \n",

She's been eating a strict Gluten free/IBS diets for a month and it's not getting better. The last time we went to the ER (4 weeks ago), they scheduled her with a new  gastroenterologist and was scheduled to see him a week ago but they called her and told her that he does not feel he needs to see her to give her a second opinion- this happened 10 minutes after she walked out of her original gastroenterologist who told her that since she is going to be seen by another gastroenterologist, she doesn't want to do anything with her. She called her original gastroenterologist after she got the call telling her she won't be seen by the other one- but she won't be able to be seen until September 23rd. \n\nShe had a colonoscopy in June of this year and nothing was found\nLast year  she had these same issues and after going back and forth to different doctors, they determined it was her gall bladder and they removed it- after they did, most of her issues went away (vomiting, upset stomach) but then they slowly came back and are back with a vengeance \nLast year, they gave her an endoscopy and found a 1/2 centimeter hiatal hernia but weren't/aren't concerned about it. She did not have an endoscopy this year\nHer white blood count has been at an 11 since last year but the doctors weren't/aren't concerned about it\nEvery once in a while, she'll poop blood (fresh blood most of the time) (doctors weren't/aren't concerned) (Have a picture if needed)\nThey found a cyst on her ovary the last time we were at the ER and it popped about 2 weeks ago \nShe smokes cigarettes (a pack a day since she was 14) (she has patches to help her quit but she's scared to use them right now because she uses the cigarets as a crutch to help her calm down)\nShe smokes marijuana daily and it helps with the pain but doesn't take it away\n\nEDIT: She was tested for celiac disease and came back negative\nMeds she's currently on:\n\nHydroxyzine Pamoate 25MG 1 capsule 3x's/day\nOndansetron ODT 4MG Tabs 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed\nClonazepam 1MG Tab.

I am dying inside because I can't help her. I see her suffering and there isn't anything I can do to take this pain away. This is why I am coming to you and hopefully, somebody can shed some light or even give us direction on how to get treatment ASAP. \nDo we go to the ER and tell them we want certain tests that weren't done before?

        "description": "Hi. I'm a 23 year old female. \nToday, while on reddit, I started encountering difficulties reading. I first noticed this as I was reading a large block of text. It was like some of the letters were sort of disappearing... the letters to the right of the ones I was currently reading. Thinking that it must be the strain of reading from a screen, I tried looking at other things, like my arm and a book. I noticed there's a blurry spot in my vision, just to the right and down from the centre of my focus. It was more like an elongated patch than a round spot... an area of wriggly lines, like static on tv.\nI was also experiencing a slight headache. I'd had this headache yesterday as well but it wasn't there when I woke up this morning. It had started again after I got on the laptop. Not much pain and there's also a slight feeling of pressure. \nI tried looking around at objects at varying distances but the blurry area was still there. I tried closing one eye and then the other, but it was there and at the same location (slightly to the right and slightly down as I mentioned earlier). \nI googled this and found that it could be a symptom of all kinds of things, from macular degeneration, retinal detachment to severe depression. I've been going through a pretty rough phase right now and reading about the possibility of future blindness sent me over the edge and I panicked and started crying (I know, overreaction). I cried for maybe about 5 minutes and then when I checked again, the problem was gone. My vision seems normal right now. I can read off the screen with no issues. But the headache is still there.\nI should mention that my mother was diagnosed with macular degeneration and my aunt (father's sister) had retinal detachment. For the past year, I've been reading off computer screens much more than usual. For a while, I have had the suspicion that my vision is going down. I've been experiencing a bit of blurriness when looking at objects far away... sometimes I can't recognize faces of people who are standing maybe about 20 feet away. I've been meaning to go see a doctor but I can't right now because life is very hectic and stressful and it will be another month or so before I can find time to go. I'll also need to keep reading off computer screens for the next month at least.\nSo can anyone here tell me more about this? Why was it cured by tears? Is it okay if I wait another month before seeing a doctor? Should I completely avoid computer screens or is it okay if I read off them for a certain number of hours per day? \nThanks in advance! Apologies for any mistakes in my English; I'm not a native speaker. \n",

Everyone else including my great grand parents have no history of cancers or dementia or any other genetic conditions...\nSo I've been getting chest pain and had it check out by the doctors. They've done all the right things and I've been on pariet (an Australian PPI I'm not sure if medication has the same names in America) as well as, a chest X-ray. The chest X-ray was as clear as day (I got it done after my chest infection) with no issues and the medication for heart burn is what I've been taking daily as per instructions. \nI'm still have chest pain, it was intermittent at first but has progressed to quite constant today. I had a constant productive cough (suspected chest infection) for two weeks with the occasional fever that has now cleared. So I went and got my X-ray because the pain is persistent and the results were clear. I've been taking pariet daily, stayed away from alcohol and spicy food as well just in case it really was heart burn, for just over two weeks now. \nI could directly point to the pain, it begins where my heart is, crosses to my right (approx to before my shoulder begins and in a straight line) and ends up hurting half way down my sternum. It's a heaviness feeling (occasionally stabbing), hurts more on inspiration and after an \"episode\" of sorts it settles to a persistent pain over my heart. \nAny advice would be wonderful. \nThank you very much! \n",

I run and eat healthy most of the time, I hardly ever drink anymore, and I stopped smoking a year ago. I was diagnosed (once again) with pneumonia this Sunday by a doctor. I recently had it last summer, and before that during the spring in 2014, which makes it 3 times in a row. This time and the last time were very painful to me. Last time it was so bad, it triggered a herpes infection outside and inside my right eye! I kinda feel like pneumonia has come to stay, and I am very afraid of it now, because of how painful and unpleasant it can be. \nI am wondering if I should see a doctor about it, so I can be examined and figure out why I have gotten it this many times already? The doctor I saw Sunday said that you are more prone to get it again if you've had before. If that's true, does this mean it's just a vicious cycle now? \nI lived in an apartment for two years which was very damp. Maybe that could have had an influence on my lungs? I moved out of it a year ago this April, though. My mom has asthma, but I don't think I have that. Pretty sure I don't.\nI would really appreciate your thoughts on this!

However, the pain is horrific. By the end of the day I can barely walk without crying and some days start that way and stay like that all day. My knees, hips, shoulders and neck are the worst. I do my physical therapy stuff and then daily activities like work and groceries and whatever nonsense my daughter has going on, but nothing outside what I know I can take. \nThe question is this: are there any ways to relieve some of the unrelenting pain? My best friend manages a health and wellness store, so he has been talking to all his reps and bringing home armfuls of random supplements and stuff, but I thought I'd ask you guys/ladies if you had some tips.\nEdit: I should have specified that I have tried all the fibromyalgia approved treatments that are on the market.
